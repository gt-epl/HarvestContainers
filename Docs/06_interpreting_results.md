# Interpreting Results

Performance isolation evaluation is particularly sensitive to systems effects (especially when evaluating at microsecond-scale latencies), and results can vary when changes are made to hardware or OS/network configuration. HarvestContainers is designed to handle CPU performance isolation, and does not consider effects from things like memory bandwidth, networking, etc. We have designed our evaluations to minimize the impact of interference from external sources, but note that the possibility of them introducing some variability still exists when running evaluations.

When evaluating the efficacy of performance isolation, most published work considers results within 10% of baseline (standalone) operation to indicate that the system is working as intended. In our experiments, HarvestContainers performed at this level and should show similar results when evaluations are run to gauge reproducibility. With HarvestContainers in particular, platform operators are free to determine a tradeoff between level of isolation and amount of CPU harvested. For example, if a platform operator decides an application can tolerate running with P99 latency 10% over standalone operation, then they can achieve more harvest. In our experiment setup, we have chosen a "middle ground" approach to balance between harvest and keeping P99 below 10% of baseline operation.
