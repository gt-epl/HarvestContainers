# Cloudlab Setup Notes

## Introduction
All experiments (functional & performance) were carried out on resources made available by [Cloudlab](https://www.cloudlab.us).
We make use of `c6420` (16 core Xeon Gold (Skylake)) machines. Refer [cloudlab docs](http://docs.cloudlab.us/hardware.html) for more details.

Performance runs were carried out on `c6420` machines. We highly recommend you use the `c6420` profiles for artifact evaluation. This profile has already been setup with most necessary dependencies.

If you'd like to setup from scratch, refer to `HarvestContainers/TestFramework/Bootstrap/firstboot.sh` for all dependencies.

## Requesting Resources on Cloudlab
We make use of the following profiles to instantiate resources (aka creating an experiment on cloudlab)
A **2 node cluster** is sufficient for all experiments. 

**From here on, we will refer the nodes as clabsvr with IP 192.168.10.10; and clabcl1 with IP 192.168.10.11**

Profiles:
1. For `c6420` - https://www.cloudlab.us/show-profile.php?uuid=70b392b8-0dc8-11ed-aacb-e4434b2381fc

>  **Note:** Cloudlab only allows you to create an experiment for upto 16 hours. You may request a reservation to create an experiment and then extend it for longer.


### Clone repository on all nodes

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gt-epl/HarvestContainers.git
```

### Setting up ssh access.
---
- We will rely on ssh keys and aliases to access and manage the physical nodes.
- All test scripts make use of ssh aliases to address and trigger runs on different machines using the aliases specified in the template config [../TestFramework/Experiments/cloudlab/template.config](../TestFramework/Experiments/cloudlab/template.config)
- Create one key-pair (cloudlab_key / cloudlab_key.pub) exclusive for cloudlab management using `ssh-keygen` shared across nodes
- Servers are assigned ip addresses in the range 192.168.10.0/24. For a 2 node cluser, this is 192.168.10.10 and 192.168.10.11
- You can resue the provided template ssh config file. Make sure the keys and usernames are updated. oneliner to configure username: `sed "s/USER/$USER/g" template.config > ~/.ssh/config`
- Ensure both the ssh config and generated public key is available on both clabsvr and clabcl1 in the `~/.ssh/` path. The output of the public key should be appendend to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
- verification: `ssh clabsvr` and `ssh clabcl1` should work on both nodes.

template config file:
```
Host clabsvr
  User USER                           <--- change this
  Hostname 192.168.10.10
  Port 22
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/cloudlab_key    <--- generated by you using ssh-keygen
  StrictHostKeyChecking=no

Host cl1
  User USER                           <--- change this
  Hostname 192.168.10.11
  Port 22
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/cloudlab_key    <--- generated by you using ssh-keygen
  StrictHostKeyChecking=no
```

> Optional: You may create a key-pair for github access as well, since most of the code will need to be pulled from the remote repo.

### Fix CPU frequencies for reproducible runs on both nodes
Run `HarvestContainers/TestFramework/Bootstrap/powerfix.sh`

### Setup Disk
1. cloudlab nodes have limited disk space. But we can mount more disk space. Do the following for both nodes.
2. Check if disk space is available (more than 500GB)
    ```bash
    # Commonly, for c6420 machines, disk space can be mounted on /dev/sda4. 
    lsblk -a

    # format drive
    sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sda4

    # create drive. Please stick to same name for drive
    sudo mkdir /mnt/extra

    # mount drive. This will be valid till next boot
    sudo mount /dev/sda4 /mnt/extra

    # change permissions if necessary
    sudo chmod -R 775 /mnt/extra
    my_group=$(groups | awk '{ print $1}') # gets the cloudlab group
    sudo chgrp -R $my_group /mnt/extra
    ```

### Relocate Docker Files
By default, Docker data directory is located at /var/lib/docker. This location is problematic on Cloudlab, since / is typically provisioned with 16 GB.  We can relocate Docker data directory with the following steps. Do the following for both nodes (clabsvr and clabcl1)
1. First stop the Docker service with sudo service docker stop
2. Make a new Docker data dir with sudo mkdir /mnt/extra/docker
3. Then edit /etc/docker/daemon.json (you will likely be creating this file from scratch) and include the following:

{
    "data-root": "/mnt/extra/docker"
}

4. Add yourself to the docker group to make life easier sudo usermod -aG docker <your_username> (you'll need to logout/login for this to take effect, but afterwards you can run docker commands w/o sudo)
5. Logout and Login again for changes to take effect.
6. helper script: [../TestFramework/Bootstrap/cloudlab/relocate_docker.sh](../TestFramework/Bootstrap/cloudlab/relocate_docker.sh) 


> Ensure CPU frequencies are fixed, disks are allocated and Docker has been relocated on all cloudlab nodes before proceeding.
